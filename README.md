# Implementing Authentication and Authorization with JWT for Task Management API (A2SV Task)
A task manager built with the Gin framework using MongoDB for its database.

## Objective
The objective of this task is to implement comprehensive unit tests for the Task Management API codebase using the testify library in Go. Unit tests help ensure the correctness of individual components and increase confidence in the stability of the application.

## Requirements:
1. Set up a test suite for the Task Management API using the testify library for writing unit tests.
2. Write unit tests to cover critical components of the API, including domain models, use cases, and any complex logic.
3. Test various scenarios and edge cases to verify the behavior of each component under different conditions.
4. Use mocking techniques provided by testify to isolate components and dependencies during testing, ensuring test independence and reproducibility.
5. Ensure proper setup and teardown procedures for tests to maintain a clean state between test cases.
6. Include assertions to verify the expected behavior and outcomes of each test case.
7. Aim for high test coverage to maximize the effectiveness of unit testing in identifying and preventing bugs.
8. Refactor existing code as necessary to improve testability and maintainability, adhering to Clean Code principles.
9. Integrate unit tests into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality.
10. Document the unit test suite, including instructions for running tests, test coverage metrics, and any issues encountered during testing.

  
## Instructions
1. Set up a test suite using the testify library to organize and execute unit tests for the Task Management API.
2. Write unit tests to cover critical components of the API, including domain models, use cases, and any complex logic.
3. Use mocking techniques provided by testify to isolate dependencies and ensure test independence.
4. Test various scenarios and edge cases to verify the behavior of each component under different conditions.
5. Include assertions to verify the expected behavior and outcomes of each test case, ensuring thorough coverage.
6. Implement proper setup and teardown procedures for tests to maintain a clean state between test cases.
7. Aim for high test coverage to maximize the effectiveness of unit testing in identifying and preventing bugs.
8. Refactor existing code as necessary to improve testability and maintainability, adhering to Clean Code principles.
9. Integrate unit tests into the CI pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality with each commit.
10. Document the unit test suite, including instructions for running tests locally, test coverage metrics, and any issues encountered during testing.

## Evaluation Criteria:
* Implementation of a comprehensive unit test suite covering critical components of the Task Management API.
* Proper use of the testify library to write effective unit tests with clear assertions and mocking techniques.
* Testing of various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness and robustness of the codebase.
* Adequate test coverage to identify and prevent bugs in critical components of the API.
* Refactoring of existing code to improve testability and maintainability, following Clean Code principles.
* Integration of unit tests into the CI pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality with each commit.
* Clarity and completeness of documentation for the unit test suite, including instructions for running tests and test coverage metrics.
* Compliance with the provided instructions and requirements.

## Note
* Unit testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of software applications. Focus on writing thorough tests that cover critical components and edge cases to increase confidence in the codebase's correctness.
